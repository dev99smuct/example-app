Clone the Repository:

Install Composer Dependencies:
Navigate into the cloned project directory and run:

```bash
   composer install```

This will install all PHP dependencies required by Laravel.

Environment File:
Make a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env. This file contains environment-specific settings, including database configuration.

```bash
  cp .env.example .env
Generate Application Key:
Run the following command to generate a unique application key for your Laravel application:
```bash
  php artisan key:generate
Configure Database:
Open the .env file and set the database connection details such as DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD to match your local MySQL database setup.

Create Database Tables:
Once your .env file is configured, run database migrations to create tables in the database:


```bash
   php artisan migrate
Seed Database (if necessary):
If the project has seeders defined, you can optionally run them to populate the database with sample data:

```bash
  php artisan db:seed
Serve the Application:
You can use Laravel's built-in development server to run the application:

```bash
php artisan serve
